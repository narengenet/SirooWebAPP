# SirooWebAPP 
Sirooweb stands as a social network engine crafted with .NET Core.

Back-End:
Leveraging Clean Architecture, this social network boasts seamless extensibility. I've personally implemented an on-memory caching system, tailored and configurable, enhancing the platform's performance.

Front-End:
The front-end harnesses jQuery API and Razor C# technology, accompanied by SCSS styling sheets. The project follows a mobile-first design approach.

Database:
Data storage is achieved through a code-first solution and Entity Framework, utilizing Microsoft SQL
